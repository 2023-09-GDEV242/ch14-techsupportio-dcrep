I have an issue with the software crashing.

The software continually
crashes!

My O/S is
Windows

It runs incredibly slow

I wish the performance was better.

This seems very buggy.

The product is very expensive

I don't understand how to install the
software

It keeps giving me out of memory errors!

neat
